I once again can not view my work because of errors. So in order to get the work done, I followed your script from the example and changed things to show my work. This time I included a screenshot of the error. The error is being caused by Preload() because last week when we didn't use it I could see my work and work on it without having to follow your script. Also the my script worked until I added Preload. Any help will be usefull or I can just continue following the example and changing it to make it my own.
