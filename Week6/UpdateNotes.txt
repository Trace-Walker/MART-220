For week 6 I couldn't really think about what to add to provide a incremental update since I've been using the homework assignments as just place to follow along and practice coding while I try and think about what I want the final product to be. I think I settled on making a frogger game because as I've been looking at referece material alot of them have been using what we been learning about the last few weeks and have more to do with animation than snake which was my orginal plan. I think I found enough material in order for me to start coding my own version of frogger made in p5js soon. Just thought I would include this update since my code will most likely look the same as from the previous week and just wanted to explain the reason for that.
